Scraping.py: This python script scrapes PDF files through the tabula library. In the script, functions are defined that perform the treatment and structuring of raw data and, at the end, it creates a .csv file with the relevant information.

Dict_and_List.py: This python script contains the dictionaries and lists used in Scraping.py. File splitting makes it easy to add new data to dictionaries
